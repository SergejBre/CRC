# CRC Generic library
The CRC Generic library is designed as a universal solution for most practical CRC methods and provides a flexible API for communication application developers.

The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is a method for determining a check value for data in order to detect errors in transmission or storage binary data. Ideally, the process can even correct the received data automatically to avoid retransmission.
